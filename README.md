# üöÄJenkins Email Notification Setup with Gmail SMTP (Step-by-Step Guide)

Email notifications are one of the most useful features in Jenkins, especially when you want to be instantly informed about the success or failure of your builds. 
In this guide, we will walk through configuring Jenkins to send email alerts using Gmail SMTP.
By the end of this tutorial, your Jenkins server will be able to automatically send emails whenever a build fails, becomes unstable, or succeeds.

## 1. Why Email Notifications in Jenkins?
When working in a CI/CD environment, it‚Äôs crucial to stay updated about your build status without constantly monitoring Jenkins. Email notifications allow you to:

- Get alerts for failed builds with error details.

- Receive confirmation for successful builds.

- Keep the entire team informed about the build status.

- Save time by focusing only when there‚Äôs an issue.

---
## 2. Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have:

- Jenkins installed and running.

- A Gmail account.

- Internet access from your Jenkins server.

- Installed the Email Extension Plugin (if you want more advanced formatting and triggers).

## 4. Enable App Password in Gmail
Since Google now blocks ‚Äúless secure apps,‚Äù you cannot directly use your Gmail password in Jenkins. Instead, we generate an App Password.

- Open Gmail and click on your profile picture in the top-right corner.

- Click Manage your Google Account.

- Enter your Gmail password if prompted.

- Under ‚ÄúSelect app,‚Äù choose Other (Custom name) and enter:
- Click Create.

```

```
- Google will generate a 16-character app password (example: lswevyqjmaoreqkf).

- Copy this password and keep it safe ‚Äî you will need it for Jenkins.

- If the option for app passwords is not available, enable 2-Step Verification in your Google account first.
